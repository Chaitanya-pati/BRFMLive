I need to fix the magnet cleaning notification logic in the precleaning process. Currently, there are issues with how cleaning notifications are triggered and displayed. Here are the exact requirements:

Core Requirements:

Notification Trigger Logic:

Notifications should appear ONLY when magnets are NOT cleaned within their fixed cleaning interval
If ALL magnets on a route are cleaned, the notification should disappear immediately
The system should check cleaning status every 5 seconds
Notifications should remind users every interval period if magnets remain uncleaned
Multiple Magnet Scenario:

If there are 3 magnets between a godown and bin, and only 1 is cleaned while 2 remain uncleaned:
Show notification: "Uncleaned Magnets: 2 of 3"
List the specific magnet names that need cleaning
Keep the notification visible until all magnets are cleaned
Once all magnets are cleaned, remove the notification immediately
Cleaning Record Tracking:

A magnet is considered 'cleaned' if there is a cleaning record for that specific transfer session
The cleaning record must be created AFTER the last notification interval
Each transfer session should track its own cleaning records separately
Current Issues:

The notification logic in frontend/src/screens/PrecleaningBinScreen.js is incorrectly checking if magnets were cleaned after the last alert time
It should instead check if magnets have been cleaned AT ALL during the current interval period
The notification should persist and re-appear every 5 seconds until ALL magnets are cleaned
When a cleaning record is added, it should immediately hide the notification if all magnets are now clean
Technical Details:

Fix the logic in the useEffect hook that checks transferSessions every 5 seconds
Update the handleSubmitCleaningRecord function to properly reset notifications when magnets are cleaned
Ensure the transfer_session_id is properly linked when creating cleaning records
The notification should check: for each magnet on a route, does it have a cleaning record for THIS transfer session?
Expected Behavior:

Start a transfer session from Godown A → Bin 1 (uses 3 magnets: M1, M2, M3)
After 5 minutes (or configured interval), notification appears: 'Uncleaned Magnets: 3 of 3'
User cleans M1 → notification updates: 'Uncleaned Magnets: 2 of 3 (Magnets: M2, M3)'
Notification continues to appear every 5 seconds
User cleans M2 → notification updates: 'Uncleaned Magnets: 1 of 3 (Magnets: M3)'
User cleans M3 → notification disappears immediately
Timer resets, and after next interval, if magnets aren't cleaned again, notification re-appears
Please fix the code in frontend/src/screens/PrecleaningBinScreen.js to implement this logic correctly."

This prompt clearly explains the issue and expected behavior, making it easier for the agent to understand and implement the fix correctly.
