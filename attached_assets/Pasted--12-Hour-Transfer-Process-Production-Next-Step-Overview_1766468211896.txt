📦 12-Hour Transfer Process (Production – Next Step)
Overview

We are implementing a 12-Hour Transfer process.

Source Bins → 24-Hour bins

Destination Bins → 12-Hour bins

12-Hour bins have smaller capacity than 24-Hour bins

Transfer is done only for a selected Production Order

🔹 Bin Selection Rules
Source Bins (24-Hour)

Multiple source bins are allowed

Only bins having available quantity for the selected production order should be shown

User selects source bins in sequence (first selected = transferred first)

Destination Bins (12-Hour)

Multiple destination bins allowed

Only bins with available capacity should be shown

User selects destination bins in sequence

🔁 Transfer Types

User must choose one transfer type:

1️⃣ Normal Transfer
2️⃣ Special Transfer
1️⃣ Normal Transfer Flow
Step 1: Select Source Bins

Multi-select 24-Hour bins

Order of selection = transfer priority

Step 2: Select Destination Bins

Multi-select 12-Hour bins

Order of selection = filling priority

Step 3: Start Transfer
Transfer Logic (Normal Transfer)

Wheat is transferred from first source bin → first destination bin

Transfer continues until destination bin capacity is full

Example:

Source Bin: 65 tons

Destination Bin-1 capacity: 25 tons

Flow:

Transfer up to 25 tons to Destination Bin-1

System shows “Divert to Next Bin”

User must:

Enter quantity transferred to current bin

Confirm

Only then:

Transfer continues to Destination Bin-2

This continues until the entire source bin is empty

Then system automatically moves to next source bin

🔒 Rule:
User cannot divert without entering and confirming transferred quantity.

2️⃣ Special Transfer Flow

Special Transfer is used when a specific source → specific destination mapping is required.

Extra Options in Special Transfer

User can select:

One additional specific source bin

One specific destination bin

User must manually enter:

Exact quantity transferred to that destination bin

Special Transfer Restrictions

Destination bins used in Special Transfer:

❌ Must NOT appear in Normal Transfer destination list

❌ Cannot be selected again until wheat is completely transferred out

Once emptied:

✅ Bin becomes available again for Normal Transfer

🧠 System Validations & Rules
General

Quantity transferred must not exceed:

Source bin available quantity

Destination bin remaining capacity

Transfer sequence must be followed strictly

Normal Transfer

Source bins processed one by one

Destination bins filled one by one

Quantity entry is mandatory before diverting

Special Transfer

Locked destination bins until emptied

Manual quantity entry mandatory

✅ Completion

Transfer completes when:

All selected source bins are emptied
OR

All destination bins are full

🎯 Expected Output from Replit Agent

UI with:

Transfer Type selector (Normal / Special)

Multi-select source bins (sequence aware)

Multi-select destination bins (capacity aware)

Transfer engine with:

Divert logic

Quantity confirmation

Bin locking/unlocking

Full validation & error handling
